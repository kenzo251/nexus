SOCK PUPPET
Possible Backstory: A powerfull Wizard accidentally enchanted a sock while doing their laundry, and the sock became sentient, and decided to set out into the world. But the real world was harsh, and the sock couldn't make it without getting a job, and after many rejected applications the nexus responed with an entry-level position as a teacher.
